### Description
I used to use openvpn and ciscoconnect and stuff like that.  
This was probably a client to easily interact with those things.  
Useless as of now, even the vpns, I'm still gonna keep them for later usage. Maybe I'll develop a fully-functional vpn client. Sort of like my tor-companion.
